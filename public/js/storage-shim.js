/**
 * ─── Web Storage shim ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MUST be the first script on the page. Classic (non-module) on purpose:
 * `<script type="module">` is deferred, so anything installed from inside the
 * module graph runs AFTER the entry chunk's static imports have already
 * evaluated — and those imports contain module-scope `localStorage.getItem`
 * calls. Only a parser-blocking classic script is guaranteed to win that race.
 *
 * Why it exists — YouTube Playables (a merge-idle-war rejection, 2026-09-02; the
 * same shim ships there):
 *
 *     Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getItem')
 *
 * Inside the YouTube Playables runtime `window.localStorage` is **null**, not
 * merely unavailable. Playables forbids every client-side persistence
 * mechanism ("Game MUST NOT use any other mechanism to save user progress"
 * besides `ytgame.game.saveData`) and enforces it by nulling the accessor. A
 * `typeof localStorage === 'undefined'` guard does not help (`typeof null` is
 * `'object'`). In survivalist the fatal one is `main.ts` itself:
 * `new SaveManager(strategy, window.localStorage)` binds `storage.clear` in its
 * constructor, so a null storage is a TypeError before the splash ever clears.
 * `safeStorage.ts` guards the module-scope READS; only this shim fixes that.
 *
 * The same failure shape shows up elsewhere, which is why this ships on EVERY
 * build and not just the YouTube one:
 *   • `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">` (no `allow-same-origin`) — an opaque
 *     origin makes any storage access throw `SecurityError`.
 *   • Chrome/Firefox with third-party cookies+storage blocked in an embed.
 *   • Some in-app WebViews (older Android WebView, embedded browsers).
 *
 * Behaviour: if the native storage is missing or throws on access, install a
 * spec-shaped in-memory `Storage` in its place. Nothing persists across a
 * reload — which is exactly right for Playables (the real persistence layer
 * is the Playgama Bridge, which routes to ytgame.game.saveData itself) and
 * strictly better than a hard crash everywhere else.
 *
 * A working native storage is left completely untouched, including the
 * quota-exceeded case: reads still work there, and swapping in a volatile
 * store would throw away a real save. We only replace what is unusable.
