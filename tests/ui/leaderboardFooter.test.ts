/**
 * ─── "You are #1,130 of 2,531" ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The modal footer is the whole reason a player who is nowhere near the top
 * opens the board at all, and it has two faults that appear ONLY when the
 * message is rendered — never when the locale files are inspected.
 *
 * A locale-parity suite (every locale carries every key, with the same
 * `{placeholders}`) passes on both of them, because neither is a fault in the
 * files. They are faults at the CALL SITE:
 *
 *   1. `yourRank` exists in the wild as both `"You are #{n}"` and
 *      `"You are #{n} of {total}"`. A project that inherited its locale files
 *      from a sibling game usually has the second, while the component was
 *      written against the first — so it passes only `{ n }`, vue-i18n drops
 *      the parameter it was not given, and the footer reads
 *      "You are #1,130 of " with a second span appending "of 2,531".
 *   2. Several languages put the POPULATION first. A footer split into a rank
 *      span and an "of N" span renders every one of them backwards.
 *
 * ── Instantiating this ──
 *
 * Point the three locale imports at this project's source locale plus two
 * others: one that groups differently from English (German, French, Russian,
 * Hindi) and one that leads with the population (Japanese, Korean, Turkish,
 * Kazakh). If the project ships neither, keep the first two cases and drop the
 * third — but check the claim before dropping it.
