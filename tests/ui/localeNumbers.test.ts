/**
 * ─── Grouping, in every locale the game actually ships ──────────────────────
 *
 * `formatCount` exists because `#41032 of 154331` is two strings of digits
 * rather than a placing. What is pinned here is not the comma — it is that the
 * separator belongs to the PLAYER, that the digits stay Latin, and that no
 * locale in the project's own list makes the formatter throw.
 *
 * That last one is why this walks `LANGUAGES` instead of a sample. A locale
 * added later with a tag `Intl` cannot parse throws at a render site on the
 * result screen, in exactly one language — which is precisely the bug that
 * reaches production, because nobody on the team plays in that language.
 *
 * ── Instantiating this ──
 *
 * Point the import at wherever the project keeps its shipped locale list. If it
 * has none (a single-language game), replace it with a literal array of the
 * tags the game could plausibly grow into and keep the rest as it is.
