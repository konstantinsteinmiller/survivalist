/**
 * ─── `tower_state` — the single persisted state object ───────────────────────
 *
 * EVERY persisted value Survivalist touches — meta progression, the resumable
 * run snapshot, user settings, retention bookkeeping — lives inside ONE
 * in-memory record (`towerState`), and exactly ONE localStorage key is ever
 * written: `tower_state`.
 *
 * Why one object:
 *   • Non-platform builds → a single localStorage entry, zero pollution.
 *   • Platform builds → `SaveManager` proxies `localStorage.setItem`, so the
 *     cloud payload is literally `{ tower_state, __save_meta__ }`. One object
 *     round-trips to CrazyGames `sdk.data` / GamePix / Playgama / Yandex /
 *     Glitch instead of dozens of per-key writes.
 *
 * Field names inside the record are catalogued in `src/keys.ts` and are all
 * `ts_`-prefixed. They are a contract with the player base: renaming one
 * strands existing players' progress on the old field.
 *
 * Writes are debounced (trailing edge, hard-capped) and hard-flushed on
 * `pagehide` / tab-hide so a close mid-burst never drops data.
