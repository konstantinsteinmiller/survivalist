/**
 * ─── Device class, resolved once, from what the browser will actually tell us ─
 *
 * Written for a playtest report that the whole quality ladder could not act on
 * in time: a Chromebook on `ANGLE (freedreno, FD618, OpenGL ES 3.2)` at
 * `devicePixelRatio` 1.6 and a 1366x768 window, running the game at 5–12 fps
 * and quitting fifteen seconds in.
 *
 * ── Why the ladder was not enough ──
 *
 * `useVfx`'s calibration is a MEASUREMENT: it opens at `high`, watches the
 * median frame time and steps down. That is the right control for the steady
 * state and it is structurally too late for this player. The measurement needs
 * frames to measure, the resolution ratchet needs a sustained verdict on top of
 * that, and every one of those frames is rendered at the resolution the ladder
 * has not yet decided is wrong — 2.7 Mpx, at ~3.5 screens of fill each, on a
 * GPU that cannot do it. The player leaves during the measurement.
 *
 * A device that says `freedreno FD618` before the first frame does not need to
 * be measured to know it should not open at 2.7 Mpx. So this module reads the
 * three signals a browser gives away for free and hands back one word.
 *
 * ── What it is allowed to change ──
 *
 * The canvas RESOLUTION, and nothing else. Not the effect tier, not the
 * particle budget, not a single pass in the renderer — those are what the game
 * LOOKS like, and a wrong guess there is a permanently worse-looking game for a
 * player whose device was fine. Resolution is the cheapest thing to give up
 * (fill cost scales with its square) and the least visible on a phone-class
 * screen, and a wrong guess is a slightly softer picture.
 *
 * ── Why the GPU string and not a benchmark ──
 *
 * A boot-time benchmark measures the machine while the machine is at its
 * busiest — parsing, compiling, decoding, baking — so it reads every device as
 * slow. The renderer string is free, stable, and names the exact part.

 *     8xx are not listed: they are current flagship parts.
 *   · Mali-T and Mali-G3x/G5x — ARM's budget line. G7x and up are not listed.
 *   · PowerVR and VideoCore — entry-level phones and the Raspberry Pi.
 *   · Intel HD/UHD 5xx/6xx — the integrated part in a decade of cheap laptops.
