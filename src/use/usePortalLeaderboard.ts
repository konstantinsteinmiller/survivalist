/**
 * ─── A portal's OWN leaderboard, beside ours ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Some portals run a board of their own: Playgama's SaaS leaderboard today.
 * This module is the platform-agnostic half of that. It knows nothing about any
 * SDK — the platform's plugin builds a `PortalBoardAdapter` and hands it over
 * with `setPortalBoard`, from its own boot branch.
 *
 * The injection is the point. `useLeaderboard` is imported by every build, and
 * a dynamic `import('@/utils/playgamaPlugin')` from here would be resolved by
 * Vite at TRANSFORM time — dragging the SDK glue into every portal's graph, and
 * refusing to build in a project that has no such file. The dependency points
 * the other way: the platform module imports this one.
 *
 * ── When it writes ──
 *
 *   • ON A WIN, and only there. The score is the deepest stage ever cleared, so
 *     the one moment a new value can exist is a stage clear — the scene calls
 *     `reportPortalBest` from its clear dispatch (`presentClear`), which every
 *     win path goes through: the stage-1 reward card, the stage 2-3 handover,
 *     the result card. A loss has nothing new to say and never posts. No
 *     throttle: a clear is at most one post per stage, and stages take 24-48 s.
 *   • ONCE ON ARRIVAL, for a player with no row yet (`joinPortalBoard`, from the
 *     scene's setup). A first-time player is posted at stage 0, so they start
 *     as the LAST row of the portal's board rather than being absent from it; a
 *     returning player who predates the board is posted at their current best.
 *     Only on an `in_game` board — never as a 0 to YouTube's native one.
 *
 * ── The rules it keeps ──
 *
 *   • NOTHING HERE MAY THROW, BLOCK OR DELAY A RUN. Every entry point resolves.
 *   • A write is remembered only after the portal accepted it, so a failed one
 *     is retried by the next clear instead of being forgotten.
 *   • NEVER LOOK BROKEN. A portal board that fails to load does not show an
 *     error: its tab disappears and the player is left on ours.
 *   • SHOWN, never RANKED against. The result screen's "#1,130 of 2,531" stays
 *     on our board; two rank sources that disagree on one screen read as a bug,
 *     a separate labelled tab does not.
