// Poki ad provider — wraps `pokiPlugin` in the cross-platform `AdProvider`
// surface consumed by `useAds`.
//
// Imports are STATIC, like `GamepixProvider` / `GameMonetizeProvider` and unlike
// the GameDistribution / Playgama providers, which lazy-load their (much larger)
// plugins via `await import('@/…')` and each need an obfuscator-exclude entry
// because `stringArray` mangles the literal into a "Failed to resolve module
// specifier" at runtime. `pokiPlugin` is small and side-effect-free at module
// scope, so a static import avoids that whole class of bug.
//
// Static imports are ONLY safe here because of the `resolve.alias` STUB SWAP in
// `vite.config.ts`: on non-Poki builds both this file and `@/utils/pokiPlugin`
// resolve to `.stub.ts` no-ops. Do not remove it on the theory that the
// env-literal gate in `resolveAdProvider` is enough — it is not, and this was
// measured, not assumed. `resolveAdProvider` statically imports every provider,
// so each provider's function BODY (with its `name: 'poki'` literal) lives in
// every bundle; and worse, the obfuscator's `stringArray` pass hoists string
// literals into its indirection table BEFORE esbuild folds
// `import.meta.env.VITE_APP_POKI === 'true'` to `false`, so the SDK URL survives
// dead-code elimination. `game-cdn.poki.com` was found in the CrazyGames entry
// chunk until the alias was added — precisely the kind of foreign-host string
// Yandex moderation rejects as "Service storage URL detected".
//
// Two Poki-specific deviations from the other providers:
//
//   • `isRewardedReady` hangs off `isPokiSdkActive` — "init has settled" — not
//     off a coarse "provider exists" flag. The PokiSDK loader shim queues `init`
//     and `commercialBreak` for replay once the real core lands, but its
//     `rewardedBreak` is a literal `() => Promise.resolve(false)`. A rewarded
//     button live during those first few hundred ms silently refuses the reward,
//     with no ad and no error. The gate is what keeps it off screen.
//
//   • `managesMidgameAudio: true`. Poki's `commercialBreak(onStart)` invokes
//     `onStart` ONLY when a video ad genuinely opens — "not every
//     commercialBreak() triggers an ad". Killing audio up front would cut the
//     win/lose stinger for an ad the player never saw. `useAds` passes its
//     `killAudioForAd` in as `onImpression` and the plugin fires it on the real
//     edge. Same posture as Yandex, opposite of GamePix.
//
// No `ownsAdBlockUi`, and `isAdsBlocked` is a constant `false`: `isAdBlocked()`
// is hardcoded `() => false` in the shipped v2 core, so there is no signal that
// could drive the shared AdsBlockedModal without also firing it on legitimate
// no-fills. Poki does not ban such a modal (that's the CrazyGames case, where
// the SDK shows its own and ours would stack) — it is simply undetectable. The
// binding rule is Poki's hard requirement that the game stay fully playable with
// a blocker active, which is verified by playing the build, not by a flag.
