 * ─── The floor under every icon-only control ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A glyph has no accessible name of its own. A button that is nothing but a
 * glyph is announced as "button" by a screen reader and is unqueryable by a
 * selector-based test — so every icon-only control in the game has to carry an
 * `aria-label`, and every call site is expected to pass one from its own screen
 * ("Next stage", not "Next").
 *
 * This map is what happens when one forgets. It is deliberately not a substitute
 * for the caller's label: a generic name is a worse label than a specific one,
 * just an enormously better one than none.
 *
 * Where the game already names an action, the key points at THAT string rather
 * than a second translation of the same word — the settings cog is
 * `options.title` in twenty-one languages already. Only the generic transport
 * and navigation glyphs, which the game had no word for, get keys of their own
 * under `ui.*`.
