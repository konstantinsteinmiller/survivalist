/**
 * ─── Numbers a player READS rather than counts ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * `#41032 of 154331` is not two numbers, it is two strings of digits that have
 * to be counted before they mean anything — and a rank you have to count is not
 * a rank. Grouped, `#41,032 of 154,331` states a position at a glance. This is
 * the whole of the leaderboard's readability problem, and it arrives the moment
 * a board passes ten thousand rows.
 *
 * The separator is not the game's to choose. A German player reads `154.331`, a
 * French one `154 331`, an English one `154,331`; picking one house style makes
 * the population look like a decimal in roughly half of any real locale set.
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` already knows every locale a game is likely to ship, so
 * the rule is to ask it rather than to hand-roll a regex with commas.
 *
 * ── Latin digits, on purpose ──
 *
 * `Intl.NumberFormat('ar')` returns `١٥٤٬٣٣١` — correct Arabic, and usually
 * wrong here. In a typical game every other number on screen (coins, score,
 * streak, damage) is painted straight to a canvas as raw Latin digits and goes
 * through no formatter at all, so an Arabic-Indic leaderboard becomes the one
 * panel whose digits do not match the HUD directly above it. Asking for
 * `numberingSystem: 'latn'` keeps the digits and takes only the grouping, which
 * is the half that was wanted. If a game DOES localise its digits everywhere,
 * drop that option here so the board follows the rest rather than fighting it.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT the `formatCount` in `useSurvivalArt.ts`, which shares the name and does
 * the opposite job: that one COMPACTS for a canvas label (1 234 → "1.2k")
 * because a five-digit number does not fit on a barricade. This one groups for
 * a DOM readout and never abbreviates — a rank the player is meant to compare
 * cannot be rounded. They never meet in one file; if a future edit brings them
 * together, rename at the call site rather than aliasing the import.
 *
 * ── Why the cache ──
 *
 * Constructing an `Intl.NumberFormat` costs far more than formatting with one,
 * and the board modal formats a rank per row for a hundred rows on every open.
 * One instance per locale, kept for the session.
